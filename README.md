This repository contains my personal OS configuration.

Use at your own risk.

## **.dotfiles creed**

<blockquote style="text-align:center;">

These are my .dotfiles.
There are many like it, but these ones are mine.

My .dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life.
I must master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my .dotfiles are useless.
Without my .dotfiles, I am useless.
I must utilize my .dotfiles true.
I must configure more readable than complexity of tools allows.
I will ...

My .dotfiles and I know that what counts in systems administration is not the commands we execute, the effect of our configurations, nor the scripts we write.
We know that it is the commit that matter.
We will commmit ...

My .dotfiles are human, even as I am human, because they are my life.
Thus, I will learn them as a brother.
I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their contents, their submodules, their scripts and executables.
I will keep my .dotfiles clean and ready.
We will become parts of each other.
We will ...

Before Kernel, I swear this creed.
My .dotfiles and I are the defenders of the operation system.
We are the masters of complexity.
We are the saviours of my life.

So be it, until true configuration is ours and thus there is no more errors, but bliss.
