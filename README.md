## **.dotfiles creed©**

>  These are my .dotfiles.
>  There are many like them, but these are mine.
>
>  My .dotfiles are my best friends.
>  They are my life.
>  I must master them as I must master my life.
>
>  Without me, my .dotfiles are useless.
>  Without my .dotfiles, I am useless.
>  I must apply my .dotfiles true.
>  I must express clearer than the ambiguity that is trying to mislead me.
>  I must resolve it before it fools me.
>  I will ...
>
>  My .dotfiles and I know that what counts in systems administration is not the commands we execute, the scripts we write, nor the logs we scan.
>  We know that it is the commits that count.
>  We will commit ...
>
>  My .dotfiles are human, even as I am human, because they are my life.
>  Thus, I will learn them as a brother.
>  I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their specs, their configs, their scripts, and their executables.
>  I will ever guard them against entropy and corruption, as I will ever guard my awareness, my focus, my logic, and my objectivity against bias.
>  I will keep my .dotfiles clean and ready.
>  We will become part of each other.
>  We will ...
>
>  Before the kernel, I swear this creed.
>  My .dotfiles and I are the defenders of the operating system.
>  We are the masters of complexity.
>  We are the saviors of my life.
>
>  So be it, until true configuration is ours and thus there are no errors, but bliss.
